      The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge
      mathematician John Conway.<br>
      This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It
      consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending
      on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.<br>
      The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
      Horton Conway in 1970.<br>
      The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
      further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
      evolves.

      The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is
      in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts
      with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each
      step in time, the following transitions occur:
      <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
      </ol>
      These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.</li>
        <li> All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
      </ol>
      The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above
      rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at
      which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules
      continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

      In late 1940, John von Neumann defined life as a creation (as a being or organism) which can reproduce itself and
      simulate a Turing machine. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic
      components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<br>
      This turned out not to be realistic with the technology
      available at the time. Stanislaw Ulam invented cellular automata, which were intended to simulate von Neumann's
      theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a
      two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular
      automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction
      was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions
      were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.<br>

      Motivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, John
      Conway began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.[3] Conway's
      initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to
      last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a
      significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that,
      indeed, Conway's Game of Life admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's
      two general requirements. While the definitions before Conway's Life were proof-oriented, Conway's construction
      aimed at simplicity without a priori providing proof the automaton was alive.<br>

      Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:
      <ol>
          <li>There should be no explosive growth.</li>
          <li>There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.</li>
          <li>There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors.</li>
          <li>The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.</li>
      </ol>
      
      The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of Scientific American, in Martin Gardner's
      "Mathematical Games" column. Theoretically, Conway's Life has the power of a universal Turing machine: anything
      that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within Life. Gardner wrote, "Because of Life's
      analogies with the rise, fall and alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing class of
      what are called 'simulation games' (games that resemble real life processes).<br>

      Since its publication, Conway's Game of Life has attracted much interest, because of the surprising ways in which
      the patterns can evolve. Life provides an example of emergence and self-organization. Scholars in various fields,
      such as computer science, physics, biology, biochemistry, economics, mathematics, philosophy, and generative
      sciences have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple
      rules.<br>
      The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat
      counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For
      example, cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett has used the analogy of Conway's Life "universe" extensively to
      illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from
      the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<br>

      The popularity of Conway's Game of Life was helped by its coming into being just in time for a new generation of
      inexpensive computer access which was being released into the market. The game could be run for hours on these
      machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later
      popularity of computer-generated fractals. For many, Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use
      otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult
      following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of
      computer systems within the confines of a Life board.
